"The media could not be loaded.This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet ""A"", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things."
"First of all, I'm so excited haha üòÖThis is my first time owning a phone. Without hesitation I just go for it with the iPhone 13 (Starlight) 128Gb. Personally I'm just obsessed with the design and the Starlight color is so cleanüòç‚ú® I also like the new camera lens layout placed diagonally. My friends think that I'm holding iPhone 15üòÖü§≠In terms of performance, I can't really give a review,  since it's my first phone there's none to compare. But I can tell it's smooth like butter.I would highly recommend to go for it if you plan on buying your first phone. ü§óü§çAccesories:Lastly, I also bought a screen protector and a case from Spigen. This doesn't change the look and design of the phone. It looks more aesthetic and I love it. Thanks for reading. See ya..üå∏"

"A phone that cost 60,000 to even over a lakh rupee appeared to be a little bit of a far-fetched Idea not long ago, when friends and family were buying iPhones. I was wondering what‚Äôs so special about this phone, I asked for different opinions, checked videos, but nobody ever clearly encapsulated the idea of an iPhone.Now that I am holding one, I can confidently say that an iPhone is not just about its great camera, or it‚Äôs great looks, an iPhone is an experience, of course, it clicks great pictures, there is nothing much to complain about the battery, but what stands out for me is the fact that an iPhone is about care. Someone, and that someone being Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, cared enough to create great products. So much that when you hold it in your hands, you don‚Äôt just feel like you‚Äôre holding a piece of technology, but rather a helpful companion that is there to help you share and communicate in ways that make it seem almost like an art. To me, an iPhone gives wings to my creative expression and that makes it what it is, an iPhone is an ally for the creative spirit in you."
"iphone product is good. but i had a very bad experience with the exchange and delivery process. i have exchanged a new phone but the delivery agent refused to do the diagnostic check for the phone once again. as i had new phone just a month back purchased the exchange process was not done propoerly . Amazon should consider such activities seriously. the delivery agent giving silly reasons and asking us to pay the extra money. i had to pay 1680 rs more as the delivery agent did not follow the exchange diagnotic check on rabbit exchange app properly. he purposely did the diagnostic to get the issue and the app showed with defect in charging port and when asked for redo the diagnostic he refused. i showed him the phone connected with charger and the phone was chargning. Amazon itself can check the exchanged phone once agai  for the condition. i have no problem with iphone nor amazon , but the delivery persons knowledge is worst and pathetic experience there is no point to echange a new phone for such low price as the app showed 5600 rs for a exhange but the delivery guy asked me to pay 1680 more this exchange offer is a scam ."
"The iPhone 13 still rocks the shelves. It is more or less the same as the iPhone 14. The two phones have the same screen size, look the same, and have many similarities.It appears that the iPhone 13 is people‚Äôs first choice when getting a new iPhone, especially if they are on a budget."
"First of all Thanks to Amazon and the seller Darshitha Ezone for this Genuine product. I Got this one @41.5k And at that price it was a better option. I compared IPhone 13 With Samsung s23 and both are premium flagship phones and if u love  Android then go with S23  at the same price or Go with Iqoo Flagship series and If u want to move iOS then Go with 13 or 16. I‚Äôm Moving from Android (Iqoo Neo 6) to IPhone 13, and since 1yr Im a IPad user so I‚Äôm habituated to iOS so it‚Äôs not a big deal for me. And coming to my Unboxing experience‚Ä¶Yeah It was very good ‚Ä¶Brand new IPhone , Great performance, Great Display, Best Haptics and Battery as expected not so long lasting as android but can easily give A day Backup on normal usage, If u use 5g continuously so More Data usage and battery backup will be around 4hrs SOT and yeah in the initial device setup hours any mobile becomes warm and now no such heating issues and back camera is awesome but front cam is still better in my Iqoo Neo6 ‚Ä¶anyone thinking 13 and 14 ‚Ä¶No difference at all but compared with 15 yeah there are some differences but not major ones and actually 15 has some major heating issues, Battery backup issues , Camera issues so don‚Äôt go with 15, if u really want Newer series go with iPhone 16 as cameras , Design,AI, Chip and other upgrades are there. But if u just want an iPhone go with 13 or 14 And actually the build quality is slightly better and Give premium feel in 13 and 14 series which is missing in 15 series. Actually I Bought this to use for 1 yr after that I‚Äôll upgrade to Newer iPhone series.Final verdict :: If u just want an iPhone then 13 or 14 is still a good choose for max 3 yrs usage.Beware of The Sellers‚Ä¶Go through their Ratings and Reviews and then only make an order."
"Yes! Finally got mine hand's on brand new I phone 13, so talking about my experience with I phone is first I was using a I phone se 2020, it was an upgrade from se 2020 to I phone 13, unfortunately most of you guys must be confused in 13/14 here's I'll clear your most of the doubt in short span of words. So talking about the major difference in 13/14 is1- 14 has 6 GB of ram / 13 has 4gbAlthough the optimisation is top-notch in I phones so that won't effect you overall in multi tasking.2- 14 has a little bit of camera change internally such as it can record 4k 30fps in cinematic mode 13 can do 1080p @30fps that's all.3- 14 has a core gpu +1 that's it!Both has a 15 bionic flagship chipsetBoth has same battery life same battery screen on time same size same phone cover can be fit identically to eachother.13 has slightly more battery life than 14 I have watched many videos on YouTube. Its always last 20/25min more because of Ram and management optimisation less load on GPU overall.Using it from few days'great experience always check your phone and do get checked on Apple official website using the serial numbers and all for genuine authentication.Display is top-notchOutdoor viability is awesome.The 60hz display doesn't feel slow at all it's definitely a good way of optimisation in display as well.The touch response is smooth and lag free.Sound the stereo speakers are soooo loud the music has good and cristal clear sound.Great I phone for greater user experience.Function and management optimisation are great.Don't buy 14 and waste your more money about 10k rather then go with 13 and buy a good case and screen guard for that price you will save more and get additional accesories for new phone!!!I'm using a ringke case as it has military grade drop protection and I'm using ringke case from 4 year's.Go for it guys!!Thank you!!"
"I finally upgraded from my trusty iPhone 5s to the iPhone 13, and let me tell you, it feels like I‚Äôve time-traveled from the past to the future! The pink color is absolutely gorgeous‚Äîit's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I‚Äôve received so many compliments on it already.The design is everything you‚Äôd expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it‚Äôs almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, ‚ÄúWelcome to the 21st century!‚ÄùThe display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. It‚Äôs crazy how much has changed‚Äîface ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.If you‚Äôre thinking about upgrading, especially if you‚Äôre coming from a much older model like I was, don‚Äôt hesitate. This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!"
"If You're Coming form 5000 mAh Battery then You Will Seriously felt the gap of battery rather then battery phone heat up fast but in other area phone performance is very well ‡•§ Have some connection issue, charging speed with original charger is very good ‡•§ Display Resolution Is Also Top Notch , Aluminium finish give this phone a premium look and feel ‡•§ In my opinion you can buy this phone if you have a tight budget ‡•§"
